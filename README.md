Meet deepSource
Helping developers ship good code.

Deepsource was founded in December 2018. We set out to build a product to automate all objective parts of the code review. We strongly believe the adoption of static analysis can increase to a great degree if they’re easier to setup and use, carefully integrated with code review workflow and has very low rate of false positives. We’re building exactly that — straightforward configuration, native integration with code review workflow in Bitbucket/GitHub/GitLab, highly accurate and actively maintained analyzers.

One of the major milestones that we just hit is the release of Autofix — in addition to detecting issues, deepsource can now also automatically fix some of the most commonly occurring issues.

We’re just starting to scratch the surface. The team is steadily adding more in-depth issues to our analyzers, increasing the coverage of issues that can be autofixed and many other useful features. Exciting times ahead!
